#### <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Techonologies & Tools**
#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i>*Android Studio*
It is designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on <i class="icon-desktop"></i> Windows, macOS and Linux, and replaced Eclipse Android Development Tools (ADT) as Google's primary IDE for native Android application development.

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i>*Gradle*
It is an open source build automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the project configuration. Gradle uses a directed acyclic graph ("DAG") to determine the order in which tasks can be run.
